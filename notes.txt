1. Security Enhancements:
Password Encryption:
Implement password hashing using libraries like BCrypt to ensure that passwords are stored securely in the database.
Session Management:
Implement session management to handle user authentication tokens (instead of re-authenticating on every action).
2. User Management Dashboard (Admin):
Since the app currently runs via a CLI interface, you could consider creating a web-based dashboard for admin users to manage the app.
Admins could:
View a list of all members and admins.
Update or delete user profiles.
Track payments and member subscriptions.
You could use Spring Boot for building a web-based backend and React or Angular for the frontend.
3. Workout Plan Management:
Feature Addition: Create a section where admins can assign workout plans to members.
Members can log their workouts, and admins can view their progress.
Extend the database to support storing workout plans, progress, and exercise logs.
4. Subscription Management:
Implement a system for tracking subscriptions:
Membership Plans: Monthly, yearly, or custom plans.
Payment Gateway: Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) for handling member payments and renewals.
Extend the database schema to include subscription details, payment statuses, and membership expiration.
5. Mobile-Friendly Interface:
You could create a mobile app for members to log workouts, view progress, and update their subscription plans.
Use React Native to create a mobile app that shares code with a web dashboard (if you go web-based).
6. Refine CLI Interface:
Improve the CLI interface by adding better navigation, error handling, and validation messages.
Enhance usability for a more polished user experience in the command line.
7. Logging and Monitoring:
Add logging features to track important events (e.g., logins, registrations, errors) for both admins and members.
Use a logging framework like Log4j or SLF4J to track issues.
8. Data Analytics and Reporting:
Add reporting tools for admins to view analytics:
User growth (new members per month).
Subscription renewals or drop-offs.
Active/inactive members (based on workout logs).
9. Email Notifications:
Add email notifications for:
Membership renewal reminders.
Admin notifications for new registrations.
Use a service like JavaMail or SendGrid for email notifications.
10. Error Handling and Input Validation:
Implement more robust error handling throughout the app:
Handle edge cases in user input (e.g., too short passwords, invalid usernames).
Provide meaningful error messages during login, registration, or other failures.
Use input validation libraries to standardize checks.
